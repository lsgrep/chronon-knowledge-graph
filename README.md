# Tutorial: chronon

Chronon is a **feature engineering platform** that helps machine learning teams *compute and serve features consistently* across training and production environments. It allows you to define features once using **GroupBy** aggregations (like "total purchases in last 7 days per user") and automatically handles both *historical backfills* for model training and *real-time updates* for online serving. The platform ensures that the features your model sees during training **exactly match** what it sees in production, preventing the common problem of *training-serving skew*.
